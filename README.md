# SuperAdventure

This is my first 2D game developed using C# and Unity. I followed the course **Aprenda Unity - Curso Gratuito - Desenvolvimento 2D** (https://www.udemy.com/share/101qH4BUoadllWRXQ=/).

To play it, download the ZIP file corresponding to your OS (Windows or Linux). If you are on Linux, run the _Jogo_Linux.x86_64_ file and on Windows, run _SuperAdventure.exe_.
